          <p>Commits in a branch or a PR is said to be <em>well-organized</em> if they have the following qualities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Each commit contains a single logical change, and this change must stand on its own.</strong> i.e. each commit has a single responsibility, and that responsibility must be fully carried out.<br>
                For example, if the commit message says <code v-pre="">Move delete() from Person class to Address class</code>, the commit cannot contain the addition of <code v-pre="">delete()</code> to <code v-pre="">Address</code> class only; it should also contain the deletion of <code v-pre="">delete()</code> from the <code v-pre="">Person</code> class for it to be a <em>complete</em> implementation what is stated in the commit message.</p>

            <li>
              <p><strong>Each commit has a <em>well-written</em> commit message</strong> i.e., it follows <a href="/guides/conventions/git.html">these guidelines</a>.</p>
